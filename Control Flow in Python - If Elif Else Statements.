# Conditional Statements:
# Basic:

temperature = 31.2
if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot!")
    print("Drink plenty of water!")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("It's nice!")
else:
    print("It's cold!")
    print("Dress accordingly!")
print("Done!")


# I want to spice things a little:

            print("It's too hot outside, stay inside if possible!")
            print("Have plenty of water with you and stay under shade!")
        elif temperature > 25:
            print("It's hot outside! Stay hydrated and under shade!")
        elif temperature >= 18:
            print("Can't get better than that! Call a friend!")
        elif temperature > 4:
            print("It's cold ouside! Dress accordinly!")
        else:
            print("It's too cold outside! Dress yourself warm and tide!")
    except ValueError:

# Ternary Operator:

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
message = "Eligible!" if age >= 18 else "Not eligible!"
print(message)


# In a while loop with input^:

print('Enter your age or "quit" for exit: ')

    if age.lower() == "quit":
        break
    try:
        age = int(age)

        print(message)
    except ValueError:
        print("Integers only, please!")

# Logical Operators:

high_income = False
good_credit = False
student = True

if high_income and good_credit and not student:
    print("Eligible for a higher loan!")
elif high_income and good_credit and student:
    print("Eligible for a student loan!")
elif (high_income or good_credit) and not student:
    print("Eligible for a lower loan!")
else:
    print("Not eligble for a loan!")


# Short-circuit Evaluation:

# 1. Logical Operators (and, or, not) are short-circuit.


# Chaining Comparison Operators:

age = 22
if 18 <= age < 65:
  print("Eligible!")
